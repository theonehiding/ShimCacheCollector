ShimCacheCollector
==================

Script(s) to collect AppCompatCache data from Windows Registry. At the moment, this contains a single script that should collect all AppCompatCache data from the Registry into a single .reg file. I've only tested this against Windows XP and Windows 7. The resulting output is ANSI rather than UTF-16 for a .reg file exported from regedit.
